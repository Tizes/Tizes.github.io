					<h2>League Of Legends</h2>
					<img src="img/lolImage.jpg">
<p>League of Legends (abbreviated LoL or just League) is a multiplayer online battle arena, real-time strategy video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows[1] and Mac OS X. It is a free-to-play game supported by microtransactions and inspired by the mod Defense of the Ancients[2] for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.
<p>In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.</p>
<p>League of Legends was generally well received at release, and grew in popularity in the years since. By July 2012, League of Legends was the most played PC game in North America and Europe in terms of the number of hours played. As of January 2014, over 67 million people played League of Legends per month, 27 million per day, and over 7.5 million concurrently during peak hours.</p></p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>League of Legends is a 3D, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. The game consists of four game modes: Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, Crystal Scar, and Howling Abyss. Players compete in matches, typically lasting 20â€“60 minutes. In each game mode teams work together to accomplish a terminal objective and achieve a victory condition, either to destroy a central objective controlled by the enemy team, known as a Nexus, or to capture and hold the most strategic points for the longest period of time. Each game mode includes a variety of smaller intermediate objectives that give players and teams advantages in achieving overall victory.

<p>In all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities. Champions begin every match at a low level (level one for Summoner's rift and Twisted Treeline, and level three for Crystal Scar and Howling Abyss), and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters, by killing or helping to kill enemy players, by destroying enemy structures, passively over time, and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and game play in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.</p>

<p>Across matches, players also earn rewards that are specific to the individual, and augment matches played. Player experience is earned by playing matches over time on a particular account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress through a maximum level of 30. As a player progresses they unlock various maps and game modes not available to new players, as well as an additional two abilities to be used in matches, known as summoner spells. Players also unlock Runes and Masteries, which can be used to provide small bonuses to a player's champion in battle.</p>

<p>All game modes use automated matchmaking based on the Elo formula, with proprietary adjustments. A player's behavior is tracked between matches, and players that display poor behavior may be subject to varying sanctions. These are delivered by an automated system, and range from warnings, to chat restriction, to temporary and permanent bans from the game. This system replaced an earlier system, called the Tribunal, which sent game logs to the community to collectively decide whether a player's behavior was sanctionable. Permanent bans were still reviewed manually.</p></p>
<h3>Game Modes</h3>
<p>Game modes
There are two primary game modes: Classic and Dominion.
<ul>

<li><p>Classic game mode requires you to destroy the enemy's nexus while defending your own and is played on the maps Summoner's Rift, the Twisted Treeline and the Howling Abyss.</p></li>
<li><p>Dominion game mode requires you to hold the majority of capture points on the map to damage the enemy nexus and is played on the Crystal Scar map.
Occasionally, special limited-time game modes will occur allowing players access to various game modes with a range of special alterations to the regular conditions and rules.</p></li>

<li><p>One for All mode was the first limited-time game type that was available during the 2013 Harrowing event. In this mode, teams banned champions similar to draft-mode. They then voted on which champion to play, and the champion with the most votes was played by the entire five person team. In the case of a tie, the champion was randomly selected from among the tied champions. One for All was played on Summoners Rift and Howling Abyss. This game mode later returned at the end of May 2014 as One For All: Mirror Mode, in which all ten players played the same champion. Mirror Mode was played on Howling Abyss.</p></li>
<li><p>Showdown was the second limited-time game mode, available during the 2013 Snowdown Showdown even. Showdown was played either one vs. one, or 2 vs. 2 on Howling Abyss. Each team played until a team achieved one of three goals: destroying an enemy turret, reaching 100 team minion kills, or killing the enemy player (or two players in two vs. two matches).<p></li>
<li><p>Hexakill mode was the third limited time game mode and was played on Summoners Rift. Each team consisted of six players instead of the typical five. Hexakill returned onto the Twisted Treeline Map, in October 24, 2014, as the seventh limited time game mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was introduced on April Fools' Day, 2014 as the fourth limited-time game type. All champions gained powerful buffs to their combat stats including: increased movement speed, faster passive gold gain, abilities cost no mana or energy, and more powerful ranged attacks. Several champions had to be disabled in this type.</p></li>
<li><p>Doom Bots of Doom was the fifth limited time game type, released on July 17, 2014. It took place on Summoner's Rift, where five players would face five AI enemies with drastically modified abilities, allowing them to deal greatly increased damage. There were three difficulty modes were available.</p></li>
<li><p>Ascension was the sixth limited time game mode and was released as part of the Shurima event on September 10, 2014. It was played on Crystal Scar. Points leading to victory could be accrued in numerous ways: by killing enemy champions, capturing Relics of Shurima, or by killing the Ascended, a powerful enemy which spawned in the center of the map, and which granted a powerful buff to the killing player. The Crystal Scar map was also modified so that the outermost area of the map was engulfed in a sandstorm so that players could only exit the spawning platforms via a teleportation item available to everyone, but players could not reenter unless they were killed. Gold and experience gain was modified so that every player gained the same amount of gold and experience, regardless of kills or assists.</p></li>
<li><p>Legend of the Poro King was the eighth limited time game mode, ending January 6, 2015, and took place on Howling Abyss. Both teams were provided with unique summoner spells allowing them to use porous, a fictional animal, in various ways. Throwing a poro and hitting an enemy champion granted one point. Once a side reached 10 points, the Poro King, a powerful minion, was spawned and fought with the allied team.</p></li>
